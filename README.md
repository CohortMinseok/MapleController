# AFK Bot
A less-detectable, easy to use MapleStory bot using fancy computer vision and clever coding. Train while you're AFK, farm mesos, boost main/secondary characters and more!

**Note: this is not cheats by any means, this bot does not access the game memory data or files.**

## Download
A download link will be added in the near future.

## Features
- Auto crash detection, restart & login
- Move & attack
- Use skills
- Predict time to rankup
- Activate buffs periodically
- Take potions (HP, MP & Pet)
- Change channels
- Avoide players (by changing channel, to ensure not getting reported)
- Activate ruins
- Teleport back after death (using hyper teleport rock)
- Settings per character
- Kanna follower (Still in development)
- And much, much more!

## Setup
1. While using the bot, maplestory MUST be on 800x600 (4:3) windowed

2. Disable UAC (only if you use the auto restart feature).
This is because when maplestory is launched, you are prompted with an admin privileges dialog, this dialog cannot be accepeted via code so in order to automate the process you'll need to disable it while using the bot.
